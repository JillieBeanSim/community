# Principles

Zowe is a project that aims to bring modern interfaces - API, command line, and visual â€“ to z/OS via an open source community. In case of disagreement within the Zowe community, the principles outlined here need to be taken into account when mediating.

## Zowe simplifies the life of Modern Mainframers
**Principle:** Modern and effective interfaces

We will provide the foundations and tools for all the vendors existing within the ecosystem to easily interface to and develop more interfaces to z/OS. The users should be able to leverage the provided tools and interfaces to get more value out of their mainframe environments. Examples domains for such tools and interfaces include web, mobile, APIs (C interfaces to HLASM, other programming interfaces, REST APIs, ...) and modern IDEs.

## Zowe does not compromise on z/OS security standards
**Principle:** Security is paramount

We commit to secure development practices, source code scans and vulnerability testing. We will never introduce a feature or change that circumvents or allows circumvention of z/OS security infrastructure. If vulnerabilities are ever found they will be flagged with fix or workaround provided.

## Transparent and open implementation, processes and deliveries
**Principle:** Open first

We will plan and develop transparently and in open. We will build an inclusive environment where anyone willing can easily find a way to contribute. 

## Collaboration between z/OS and other platforms - both mainframe and distributed - benefits both sides
**Principle:** Hybrid

We will bring lessons from the non-z/OS world to the z/OS platform as well as providing the opportunity for the non-z/OS world to benefit from the knowledge gained in the z/OS world in order to build secure and performant hybrid environments in which z/OS plays core role. 

## Decision made within the project are based on community participation and supported by data
** Principle:** Agile and data driven

We believe in agile development practives with small teams, iterative development, etc. and we are data-driven with respect to quality and performance metrics.

## We will listen to our stakeholders and elicit feedback from them.
**Principle**: Stakeholder-centric

We are stakeholder-centric project where stakeholders include end-users, exploiters, deploying enterprises or the Zowe Advisory Council. We will keep the best interests of our stakeholders in mind and elicit feedback from them as much as possible, incorporate feedback when planning future work, and keep our stakeholders informed on Zowe's evolution and how their feedback is received and responded to.

## The Zowe doesn't depend on and isn't owned by any specific Vendor
**Principle:** Vendor Neutral

We will keep Zowe vendor neutral. No company can claim that it owns Zowe. If we use technology specific to a vendor or company we need a very strong argument and a means to move away from that technology if the vendor intends to leverage the technology counter to our principles.

## Squads are self-governing
**Principle:** Minimal Viable Governance

We build only minimum necessary policies and governance and let the squads deliver the value in a way that fits them without endangering the whole project.
