# Principles

Zowe is a project that aims at bringing modern interfaces and open source tools to the mainframe platform. What follows is a set of principles agreed upon by Zowe. In case of disagreement within the Zowe, the principles outlined here needs to be taken into account when mediating.

## Zowe simplifies the life of Modern Mainframers
**Principle:** Modern and effective interfaces

We introduce and integrate the interfaces such as Web, Mobile, APIs, Modern IDEs, Chat that simplifies work with the mainframe. We intend to provide the foundations and tools for all the vendors existing within the ecosystem to easily provide the interfaces with the Zowe capabilities. The users should be able to leverage the provided tools to get more value out of their mainframe environments. 

## We are't interested in technologies that didn't yet proved their value within either mainframe or distributed environment
**Principle:** Proven technologies

We introduce the tools that are standard and proven within the distributed environment. We learn the best that's there and make sure it is applicable within the mainframe environment. We don't intend to adopt unknown and niche technologies with limited benefit for teh whole mainframe ecosystem. 

## Zowe keeps the zOS security Standards
**Principle:** Secure

We respect the high security of the mainframe environment and intend to keep the same level of security while being able to leverage modern open source libraries and tooling created outside of the mainframe platform and giving the key tools to the hands of the Zowe users. 

## Transparent and open implementation, processes and deliveries
**Principle:** Open First

We intend to develop and plan transparently and in open. We will build inclusive environment where anyone willing to contribute can easily find a way how to do it. 

## Collaboration between Mainframe and distributed is good and both sides benefit
**Principle:** Hybrid

We intend to bring the lessons from the distributed environments to the MainFrame platform as well as providing the opportunity to the distributed environment to benefit from the knowledge gained in the MainFrame environment in order to build secure and performant hybrid environments in which the mainframe plays core role. 

## The decision made within the project whould be based on reality and supported by data
** Principle:** Data drive

We are data-driven project. When we need to make a major decision we will consult the data that we can access to help us reach the decision. 

## We intend to listen to our users and elicit feedback from them.
**Principle**: User centric

We are user-centric project. We intend to keep the best interests of ours users in our mind. We intend to get the feedback from them as much as possible and keep it in mind when planning future work. 

## The Zowe doesn't depend on and isn't owned by any specific Vendor
**Principle:** Vendor Neutral Development

We intend to keep Zowe vendor neutral. No company should be able to claim that it owns Zowe. If we use technology specific for a vendor or a company we need t ohave a very strong argument and a way to move away from them in case the cendor intends to levearge them against the Zowe.

## Squads are self-governing
**Principle:** Minimal Viable Governance

We build only minimum necessary policies and governance and let the squads deliver the value in a way that fits them without endangering the whole project.
